## 🎯 What is SAR-MiniGrid?

Imagine a building on fire. Victims are trapped. Some rooms are locked. Lava (yes, lava!) blocks your path. Your mission? **Save everyone before time runs out.**

SAR-MiniGrid is a reinforcement learning environment that puts your agent in high-stakes rescue scenarios. Can your AI learn to be a hero?

| 🎯 **Real vs Fake Victims** | Distinguish cross-shaped victims ✚ from T-shaped decoys ⊤ |
| 🔥 **Lava Hazards** | One wrong step and it's game over! |
| 🔐 **Locked Rooms** | Find keys to unlock doors and reach trapped victims |
| 🎮 **Interactive GUI** | Beautiful Pygame interface with real-time info |
| 🤖 **RL-Ready** | Gymnasium compatible for training your rescue agents |
